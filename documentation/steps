🎯 What We Do in STEP 1

Before touching code, we must decide how the website looks.

In this step we will finalize:

Color palette

Layout structure

Pages design

Dashboard sections

📌 Rule:

If the UI is clear → coding becomes EASY
If UI is confusing → project fails ❌

🎨 1. COLOR PALETTE (FINAL)
Primary Colors (Finance-safe)

Primary Blue: #2563EB

Light Blue background: #F1F5F9

Success / Income: #16A34A

Expense / Danger: #DC2626

Text Dark: #0F172A

Card White: #FFFFFF

👉 This gives a clean professional fintech look

✍️ 2. FONT & STYLE

Font: Inter (Google Font)

Border radius: 12px

✅ STEP 1 DONE WHEN:

✔ You understand every page
✔ You can imagine the dashboard
✔ Colors & layout are fixed

🚀 NEXT STEP (STEP 2)
STEP 2 = Project Setup + Folder Structure (React way)

Create React app

Clean unwanted files

Setup folders (components, pages, services)

Install required packages

Still NO backend yet — frontend skeleton first.

STEP 5 — Add Expense / Transaction Form
📌 Goal

Create a form that allows users to add Income or Expense transactions and store them in the application state.

This is the core feature of the Expense Tracker because without transactions, no calculations or reports are possible.

✅ What We Implemented
🔹 Input Fields

The form collects:

Title (transaction name)

Amount

Type (Income / Expense)

Category

Date

🔹 Functional Behavior

When the user:

Fills the form

Clicks Add / Save

The system will:

✔ Validate inputs
✔ Create a new transaction object
✔ Store it in state
✔ Update dashboard totals instantly
✔ Clear the form

🔹 Transaction Object Structure

Each transaction follows a structured format:

id

title

amount

type

category

date

This makes it easy to:

Filter

Calculate totals

Delete

Edit later

🎨 UI/UX Decisions

✔ Clean card layout
✔ Minimal inputs only
✔ Dropdowns for fewer mistakes
✔ One main action button
✔ Mobile friendly spacing

Rule followed:

👉 Fast entry → Less typing → Better UX

💡 Why STEP 5 is Important

This step enables:

Data entry

Real-time calculations

Future features (charts, reports, budgets)

Without this step, the app has no usable data.

🎯 STEP 6 — Transaction History + Dashboard Calculations
📌 Goal

Display all transactions and automatically calculate:

Total Income

Total Expense

Balance / Savings

This makes the app actually useful for tracking money.

✅ What We Implemented
🔹 1. Transaction List (History Table)
Displays:

Date

Title

Category

Type

Amount

Actions (Delete)

Functional Features

✔ Shows all added transactions
✔ Income highlighted in green
✔ Expense highlighted in red
✔ Delete option removes item instantly
✔ UI updates automatically

🔹 2. Dashboard Summary Cards

We added real-time calculation cards:

Cards:

Total Income

Total Expense

Balance (Income − Expense)

Logic

System automatically:

✔ Loops through all transactions
✔ Separates income and expense
✔ Calculates totals
✔ Displays values instantly

🎨 UI Design Choices
Cards

Rounded corners

Soft shadow

Color-coded

Big numbers for clarity

Table

Clean rows

Proper spacing

Simple action buttons

No clutter

🧠 UX Rules Followed

✔ Information visible at first glance
✔ No unnecessary clicks
✔ Instant updates
✔ Simple delete action
✔ Beginner friendly layout

💡 Why STEP 6 is Important

This step converts raw data into useful insights.

Now users can:

✔ Track spending
✔ See savings
✔ Understand financial habits
✔ Make decisions

Without this → it’s just a form
With this → it becomes a real finance app

✅ After STEP 6, Our App Can

✔ Add transactions
✔ Store data
✔ Show history
✔ Delete entries
✔ Calculate totals
✔ Show balance

This is now a fully working basic Expense Tracker (MVP)
